            <p>
                I'm a Software Developer at Oregon State University. I've been working on web applications for almost 4 years now.
                I develop enterprise applications for customers and help them define business flows and optimizations. 
                I manage a team of students to produce web and mobile applications using technologies 
                such as .NET core, Angular, and React. I also create scalable applications and host them in AWS ECS.
                I'm currently learning native Android and iOS.

                I live in Corvallis Oregon and I'm planning on moving to Portland this year.

                On my free time, I try to be outside as much as possible. I love the Pacific Northwest! I enjoy
                hikes, disc golf, snowboarding, and weightlifting.
